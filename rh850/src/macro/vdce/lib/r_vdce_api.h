                                     If this flag is not set, output Vsync changes to externally input 
                                     Vsync signal while the capturing is enabled. 
  R_VDCE_CAP_MODE_BIG_ENDIAN       - Captureing with big endian. If this flag is not set, little endian 
                                     is selected.
  
  Note:
  If R_VDCE_CAP_MODE_YUV_ITU656 or R_VDCE_CAP_MODE_YUV_8BIT is selected, each pixels are 
  captured twice. Therefore width of <R_VDCE_CapBufGeometrySetup> must be doubled and 
  horizontal size must be scaled down by half in order to keep original input size.

  Note:
  If R_VDCE_CAP_MODE_FIXED_VSYNC is set, the interrupt R_VDCE_INTC_NO_VI_VSYNC_SIGNAL or 
  R_VDCE_INTC_NO_VI_VSYNC_SIGNAL_1 does not occur.
  If R_VDCE_CAP_MODE_FIXED_VSYNC is not set, flickering may be displayed at the capture enable/disable 
  timing.

  The Unit parameter holds a number that specifies the video output number being initialized. 
  A used flag is set inside the driver structure to lock it being initialized and currently used.
  The driver makes sure, that the macro is set into a default configuration.
  It is also in the responsibility of the driver to keep track of the macro instance status and
  to avoid, that the macro instance is initialized more than one time or that
  any other function can be executed before the initialization has been completed successfully.
  If the function successfully execute, the return code will be <R_VDCE_ERR_OK> and
  the state will be in the initialized state.
  This API function uses <R_VDCE_Sys_Lock> and <R_VDCE_Sys_Unlock> to prevent multiple execution.
  When executing this API function by the interrupt handler, be careful of <R_VDCE_Sys_Lock> and

/***************************************************************************
  Function: R_VDCE_LayerViewPortSet

  Description:
  This function sets the layers viewport parameters.
  This setting is valid until <R_VDCE_DeInit> is executed.
  This API function uses <R_VDCE_Sys_Lock> and <R_VDCE_Sys_Unlock> to prevent multiple execution.
  When executing this API function by the interrupt handler, be careful of <R_VDCE_Sys_Lock> and
  <R_VDCE_Sys_Unlock> having to be able to be executed by the interrupt handler.

  Parameter:
  Unit       - It specifies the video output number.
  LayerNr    - It specifies the layer from the following.
                 R_VDCE_LAYER_SCALER0 / 
                 R_VDCE_LAYER_SCALER1 / 
                 R_VDCE_LAYER_IMAGE2  / 
                 R_VDCE_LAYER_IMAGE3  
  MemPosX    - This is the memory position x coordinate. Range is 0 only.
  MemPosY    - This is the memory position y coordinate. Range is 0 only.
  DispPosX   - This is the display position x coordinate. Range is -1280 to 1279.
               Hs(Horizontal signal start position) is the sum of "display position x"
               and "horizontal blank width". When the sum(Hs) falls below the LOC_HS_MIN, 
               Hs is set to LOC_HS_MIN. LOC_HS_MIN is 16. 
               For example, in case of "horizontal blank width"=-160, the lower range of 
               "display position x" is -144(=-160+16).
  DispPosY   - This is the display position y coordinate. Range is -1024 to 1023.
               Internal "Vs" (Vertical signal start position) is the sum of "display position y"
               and "vertical blank width". When the sum(Vs) falls below (LOC_VS_MIN+1), 
               Vs is set to (LOC_VS_MIN+1). LOC_VS_MIN is 4. 
               For example, in case of "vertical blank width"=-10, the lower range of 
               "display position y" is -5 (=-10+4+1).
  DispWidth  - This is the displayed width of the layer. Range is 3 to 1280.
  DispHeight - This is the displayed height of the layer. Range is 1 to 1024.

  Return value:
  See <r_vdce_Error_t>.

  Executable Layer Status:
  Uninitialized - NG
  Initialized   - OK
  Idle          - OK
  Executing     - OK (Parameters become effective at the timing of next Vsync.)

  Description:
  This function sets the parameters for the capture buffers and the size of the incoming video data.
  This setting is valid until <R_VDCE_DeInit> is executed.

  When executing this API function by the interrupt handler, be careful of <R_VDCE_Sys_Lock> and
  <R_VDCE_Sys_Unlock> having to be able to be executed by the interrupt handler.

  Parameter:
  Unit     - VDCE unit number to capture.
  Buffer1  - Address of the first buffer, which is used to capture the first field.
             Lower 7 bits are clamped to 0. If this is set to 0 then returns error.
  Buffer2  - Address of the second buffer, which is used to capture the second field.
             Lower 7 bits are clamped to 0. If this is set to 0 then Buffer2 = Buffer1.
  Stride   - When switching to the next line of the capture buffer, Stride pixels will be added.
             Range is 1 to 4096.
             Lower 7 bits of Stride multiplied by bytes per pixel are clamped to 0.
  Width    - The parameter specifies the width of the incoming video in pixels.
             Range is 4 to 2011. Lower 2 bits are clamped to 0.
             Range of sum of StartX and Width is 2015 and less.
             When Width is greater than 1024 pixels, horizontal image size must be reduced to 1024 
             pixels or less.
  Height   - The parameter specifies the Height of the incoming video in pixels.
             For an interlaced video, the height will be the height of one frame.
             Range is 4 to 1024. Lower 2 bits are clamped to 0.
             Range of sum of StartY and Height is 2039 and less.
  StartX   - The parameter specifies the synchronized mode and skipped pixels. 
             When StartX is set to the range of 16 to 2011, video input synchronize with Hsync signal 
             and StartX pixels are skipped after horizontal synchronization, before capturing starts. 
             When StartX is set to 0, video input synchronize with Data Enable signal and capture starts 
             from first cycle of data enable. This mode can't be supported in case of interlace input.
  StartY   - When StartY is set to the range of 4 to 2035, StartY+1 lines are skipped after vertical 
             synchronization, before capturing of the first field starts.
             When StartY is set to 0, no line is skipped. 
             When video input synchronize with Data Enable signal (StartX = 0), StartY must be setting 
             to 0.
             When video data is input from MIPI, capturing should start from top/left screen if 
             StartX = 17 and StartY = 0 are set.

  Description:
  This function enables the video capturing.
  Execute <R_VDCE_CapBufGeometrySetup> and <R_VDCE_CapModeSet> before executing this function.
  If the function successfully execute, the return code will be <R_VDCE_ERR_OK> and

  Capture data is connected to the following layer by conformation of geometry setup. 
  If OutputUnit is set as 0 or 1, this function enables the connecting layer. So Execute 
  <R_VDCE_LayerFormatSet>, <R_VDCE_LayerMemGeometrySet> and <R_VDCE_LayerViewPortSet>
  before executing this function. Layer control like a Scaling-down should be set to connecting 
  layer.

  If R_VDCE_CAP_NO_DISPLAY is specified, the capturing starts independently of the layer control and 
  displaying. So, layer control like a Scaling-down is not available. And, capture option of 
  R_VDCE_CAP_MODE_H_MIRRORING and R_VDCE_CAP_MODE_V_MIRRORING are not available too.
  
  
  Parameter:
