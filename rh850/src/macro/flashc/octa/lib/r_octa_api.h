  typedef: r_octa_DQSDelay_t

  Description:
  This type describes the DQS (Data Strobe Signal) delay.

  Struct members:
  EnableCnt  - DQS enable counter.
               During read operation with DQS clock input (RAM/OPI/DOPI mode), 
               DQS clock will transition from high-impedance to zero after command/address 
               phase is finished. 
               To prevent using such invalid DQS clock, user can adjust these configuration 
               to guarantee data correctness.
               The range is 0 to 15. Actual enable DQS clock input is set value + 1 clock.
               If EnableCnt=0 is set, Enable DQS clock input at 1st SCLK.
               If EnableCnt=1 is set, Enable DQS clock input at 2nd SCLK.
               If EnableCnt=2 is set, Enable DQS clock input at 3rd SCLK.
               If EnableCnt=3 is set, Enable DQS clock input at 4th SCLK.
               ...
               If EnableCnt=15 is set, Enable DQS clock input at 16th SCLK.
               
               Reference DQS enable counter settings (when SCLK frequency < 120 MHz)

  Function: R_OCTA_DataWriteRWW

  Description:
  This function writes data to the Octa Flash memory by RWW (Read-While-Write) function.
  
  RWW function means read data one bank while another bank is programing or erasing.

  This function can be executed for Octa flash memory with supporting RWW.
  If Octa flash memory is not supported RWW, does not guarantee the operation.
  
  This function is executed WriteBufInitial, WriteBufContinue and WriteBufConfirm
  command. These commands to be set are different depending on the data transfer mode.
  
  In DTR OPI, the starting address given must be even address (A0=0) and data byte number must be even.
  
  This function has the possibility that the processing takes time.
  Therefore, <R_OCTA_Sys_Relax> is sometimes executed.
  
  This function calls <R_OCTA_Sys_Lock> and <R_OCTA_Sys_Unlock> internally.
  If this function is executed from the interrupt handler, please be careful of 
  specification of <R_OCTA_Sys_Lock> and <R_OCTA_Sys_Unlock>.


  Parameter:
  Unit     - Instance number.
  Channel  - Device Channel number.
  Addr     - The parameter specifies the write address of the Octa flash memory.
             If the data transfer mode is R_OCTA_MODE_DOPI, Addr given must be even address.
  Buf      - This is a pointer to the buffer stored write data.
  Size     - The parameter specifies the data byte-size to write.
             If the data transfer mode is R_OCTA_MODE_DOPI, Size given must be even data size.

  Return value:
  R_OCTA_ERR_OK               - No error has occurred.
  R_OCTA_ERR_PARAM_INCORRECT  - A parameter is incorrect.
  R_OCTA_ERR_RANGE_UNIT       - Unit number is out of range.
  R_OCTA_ERR_RANGE_PARAM      - A parameter is out of range.
  R_OCTA_ERR_NOT_ACCEPTABLE   - A function was called in an incorrect state.
  R_OCTA_ERR_FATAL_OS         - Fatal error has occurred at OS interface.
  R_OCTA_ERR_FATAL_HW         - Fatal error has occurred at H/W.
  R_OCTA_ERR_PROTECTED        - A process is aborted because of memory protection.
